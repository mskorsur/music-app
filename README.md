# music-app
CRUD application for managing a music library.

Simple application built to further extend my knowledge of the tools and frameworks used. 
Back-end is realised as a Node/Express API for basic CRUD operations on
albums and artists. The API communicates to MongoDB for storing and retrieving records. 


Front-end side is built with React.js framework and consists of a simple interface that
supports mentioned operations on the music library. This client side app consumes the API
for all data requirements.


To see the app working in actions, run the following commands:
`npm run devstart` in main directory and `npm start` in client-app subdirectory.
